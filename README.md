# Melbourne-Police-Location-Prediction
Reported Police Locations for the City of Melbourne were scraped from the Waze API for a period of 12 months, in order to train a machine learning model that will be able to predict future locations of Police.


## Prediction Process

Firstly historical data is loaded into the software via the "Load CSV" button, this takes approximately 15 minutes for 40 megabytes of data. Then the machine learning model must be trained and finally then predicted locations can be generated.
